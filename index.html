    <h3 class="subheadingone">Jenna Marbles</h3>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/JennaMarbles"><img alt="picture of jenna marbles"src="http://c0.thejournal.ie/media/2018/06/jenna-marble-feat-752x501.png" width="250" height="150"></a>
    <p class="left">Jenna Marbles is a lifestyle youtuber who never fails to try the impossible. She makes videos on various different topics, from vlogging her dog’s birthday to painting her face to look like her dog, turning into a disco ball, or green screening her entire body. Her sense of humour and genuine passion for video-making makes her one of my favorite youtubers to watch.

    <h3 class="subheadingtwo">Binging with Babish:</h3>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/bgfilms"><img src="https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/grub/2018/08/30/30-binging-with-babbish-grub-diet-2.w700.h700.jpg" width="225" height="250"></a>
    <p class="right">This youtube channel transforms food we see in the cinema to food in real life. The host has made Ratatouille from the iconic Disney movie, Krabby Patties from SpongeBob, and my personal favorite, spinach puffs from the Emperor’s New Groove! His channel is definitely worth a watch.

    <h3 class="subheadingone">Olay CC Tone Correcting Moisturizer:</h3>
    <a href="https://www.olay.com/en-us/skin-care-products/cc-cream-total-effects-tone-correcting-moisturizer-light-to-medium-skin"><img src="https://tshop.r10s.com/019/9c0/c2ed/b5b9/d112/5eb2/6293/1180e793322c600c7373af.jpg" width="125" height="150"></a>
    <p class="left">This is a cheap and easy moisturizer to use. It’s easy to travel with and it provides just enough coverage without feeling too heavy. I recommend it for an everyday or natural look, and a fun bonus is that it already has sunscreen, so you don’t have to worry about getting skin cancer!

    <h3 class="subheadingtwo" >Maybelline Great Lash Mascara:</h3>

    <p class="right">This classic mascara is one of my favourites! It gets the job done without getting clumpy and is easy to use! The fact that it is waterproof is also a plus!

    <h2>Books:</h2>
    <h3 class="subheadingone"><em>Drita, My Homegirl</em> by Jenny Lombard</h3>
    <a href="https://www.scholastic.com/teachers/books/drita-my-homegirl-by-jenny-lomba"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Zc8yH7Z1L.jpg" width="125" height="150"></a>
    <p class="left">This book is one that I have loved since third grade. It describes the friendship between a NYC born girl and a Kosovo refugee. It teaches valuable lessons about acceptance, friendship, and inclusion I think are valuable today more than ever.
    </p>
    <h3 class="subheadingtwo"><em>George’s Marvellous Medicine</em> - Roald Dahl</h3>
    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Georges-Marvelous-Medicine-Roald-Dahl/dp/0142410357"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91Rd5VXqrcL.jpg" width="200" height="250"></a>
    <p class="right">This book <strong>SLAPS!</strong> I loved this book! Despite what others may tell you, I am a firm believer that this book is for all ages. The book discusses George’s adventures to make his grandmother medicine to cure her grouchiness. It is one of my all time favourite books and I highly recommend it!
